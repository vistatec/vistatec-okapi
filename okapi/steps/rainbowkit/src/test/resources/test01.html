<a href="http://www.opentag.com/okapi/wiki/index.php?title=Rainbow_-_Translation_Package_Creation">Translation Package Creation</a></b> 
and the <b>
<a href="http://www.opentag.com/okapi/wiki/index.php?title=Rainbow_-_Translation_Package_Post-Processing">Translation Package Post-Processing</a></b> utilities included 
in Rainbow.</p>
<p>The first one allows you to prepare translation kits that can be translated, 
edited and reviewed with different translation tools. The second one is used to 
post-process the packages after they have been translated.</p>

<h2><a name="prerequists"></a>Pre-Requisits</h2>
<p>To complete this tutorial you must have Rainbow v6 installed and working. Note 
that for Rainbow to run properly you must also have Java&nbsp;1.6 or later installed 
on you system.</p>
<p>You should also have a copy of the sample files for this tutorial on your machine, for example in
<code>C:\Tmp\tutorials\turorial_02\files</code>.</p>
<h2><a name="setupinputdoc"></a>Setting up the Input Documents</h2>
<p>Start Rainbow.</p>
<p>To make sure you are starting this tutorial in a fresh environment, you 
should first create a new project: Select the command <cite>New</cite> in 
the <cite>File</cite> menu, or press <kbd>Ctrl+N</kbd>.</p>
<h3><a name="savingProject"></a>Saving the Project</h3>
<p>It is recommended to start by saving the Rainbow project file. This allows 
you to safely use relative paths for all the parameters of your project and 
therefore to be able to move the project and its file around without having to 
reset any paths.</p>
<p>To save the project select the <cite>Save</cite> command from the <cite>File</cite> 
menu. Enter a filename with the path of where your tutorial files are. for 
example <code>C:\Tmp\tutorials\tutorial_02\files\preparation.rnb</code>.</p>
<h3><a name="inputdocs"></a>Input Documents</h3>
<p>Select the <cite>Input List 1</cite> tab. This is the list where we will 
enumerate all the source documents to prepare.</p>
<p>Select the command <cite>Add Documents</cite> from the <cite>Input</cite> 
menu, or press <kbd>Ctrl+Insert</kbd>. This opens the <cite>Add Documents</cite> 
dialog box where you select the source documents you want to prepare. You can 
also simply drag and drop the documents on the list. All documents must be in or 
below the input root directory you have chosen for the source, in our case the 
directory where you saved the project.</p>
<p>Select all the files named <code>file1.xxx</code> where xxx are different 
extensions. There are also files in a sub-directory called <code>subFolder</code>.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="rainbow1.png" width="632" height="461"></p>
<p>Now, if needed, you need to associate each file to its filter. The filters 
are used to parse the documents and separate the translatable text from the code 
parts of the files. In this example all the files are associated with default 
filters based on their extensions, so there is nothing special to do.</p>
<h3><a name="langandencodings"></a>Languages and Encodings</h3>
<p>The next step is to make sure languages and default encodings are set 
properly. Select the <cite>Languages and Encodings</cite> tab.</p>
<p>You need to specify the language of the source and target documents, as well 
as the default encoding to use to read the documents in case they are not in a 
format where the encoding can be auto-detected.</p>
<p>In this example, the source language is English and we will use French as the target language. 
We will also use UTF-8 for the source and target default encodings.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="rainbow2.png" width="632" height="461"></p>
<p>Move to the <cite>Other 
Settings</cite> tab.</p>
<p>You define here the names of the translated files as they will be generated 
during after post-processing. By default they are the same names as the input 
document with an additional <code>.out</code> placed just before the final 
extension.</p>
<p>In this example we will change the settings and replace the <code>.out</code> 
by a <code>.${TrgLang}</code>. The macro <code>${TrgLang}</code> can be used 
anywhere in the output option. It will be replaced at runtime by the code of the 
target language (here &quot;<code>FR-FR</code>&quot;).</p>
<p><img border="0" src="rainbow3.png" width="632" height="461"></p>
<h2><a name="invokeutility"></a>Invoking the Translation Package 
Creation Utility</h2>
<p>All the previous steps were performed to define general settings that are used with all 
Rainbow utilities. Now comes the part that is specific to the <b>Translation 
package Creation</b> 
utility.</p>
<h3><a name="utilityoptions"></a>Setting up the Utility Options</h3>
<p>Select the command <cite>Translation package Creation</cite> in the <cite>
Utilities</cite> menu. This will bring up the dialog box where you set the 
options specific to the utility and launch it.</p>
<p>The <cite>Package Format</cite> tab allows you to select what kind 
of translation kit you want to create. In this example we will use the one 
called <cite>OmegaT</cite>. OmegaT is an open-source translation tool.</p>
<p>Select <cite>OmegaT</cite> in the list of available packages.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="package.png" width="600" height="272"></p>
<p>Move to the <cite>Package Location</cite> tab.</p>
<p>This is where you defined the place where you want to generate the 
translation kit. There are two things to define: The root output directory and 
the package name. Both are combined together to make up the final output 
directory. For example, if you define <code>C:\Tmp\TKits</code> as the root 
output directory and <code>Pack1</code> as the package name, the files will be 
generated in <code>C:\Tmp\TKits\Pack1</code>.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="location.png" width="600" height="272"></p>
<p>In our example, we will use the default location which is 
represented by a variable: <code>${ProjDir}</code>. It corresponds to the 
directory where the project is saved. And for the name, we will use <code>pack1</code>.</p>
<p>Move to the <cite>Options</cite> tab.</p>
<p>Here you can specify to compress the package into a single ZIP 
file. We will not do this in the example.</p>
<p>You can also decide to pre-segment the document. This can be useful 
when you have some existing translation memory that you want to apply for 
example. In this example we will not pre-segment.</p>
<p>Move to the <cite>Pre-Translation</cite> tab.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here you can specify to leverage 
existing translation into the package using different translation resources 
(Pensieve TM, machine translation, etc.). We won't use this option in this 
example.</p>
<p>At this point all the options we need have been set.</p>
<p>Click <cite>OK</cite> to start the process.</p>
<p>If all goes well, you will not get any error or warning messages.</p>
<h2><a name="packageOutput"></a>Package Output</h2>
<p>The result of the preparation can be seen in the <cite>Root of the 
output directory</cite> you specified. You can open that folder from Rainbow by 
selecting the command <cite>Open Last Output Folder</cite> from the <cite>
Utilities</cite> menu, or pressing <kbd>Ctrl+L</kbd>.</p>
<p>The package should look like this:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="output.png" width="524" height="303"></p>
<p>The file <code>manifest.xml</code> contains all the information 
needed to merge the translation back into the original file formats. You should 
never delete, rename or change in any way this file. The same goes for the <code>
original</code> sub-directory. It contains all the files you need to 
post-process the translation.</p>
<p>For an OmegaT project, the extracted files are located in the <code>
source</code> sub-directory. These are the documents will will need to 
translate. Note that the directory structure has not been ported here: OmegaT 
does not allow this. So, instead all the files have their ID as prefix to allow 
files with the same name but in different sub-directories to be processed. the 
correct directory structure will be re-generated when post-processing the 
translated files.</p>
<p>The <code>omegat</code> sub-directory may contain a file called
<code>project_save.tmx</code> that contain any existing translation that was 
labeled as &quot;approved&quot; in the original documents. In our example, we have such 
file as both the PO and the XLIFF input documents have existing translations 
that are already approved.</p>
<p>The <code>tm</code> sub-directory may contain TMX files as well:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p><code>unapproved.tmx</code> for any existing translation found 
	in the input document that was not labeled as &quot;approved&quot; yet. In out example 
	we have such file as both the PO and the XLIFF input documents have existing 
	translations that are not approved yet.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p><code>alternate.tmx</code> for any alternate translation found 
	in the input document. In our example we have such file because the XLIFF 
	input document has a <code>&lt;alt-trans&gt;</code> element for one of its 
	translation units.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p><code>leverage.tmx</code> for any translations found in TMs used when 
	pre-translating. In this example we do not have such output.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="translating"></a>Translating</h2>
<p>You can now open the project with OmegaT and translate.</p>
<p>Start OmegaT</p>
<p>Select the command <cite>Open</cite> from the <cite>Project</cite> menu. And 
select the directory of the project. The program will open the project files and 
you can proceed to translating the documents. Any existing approved translation 
will be set directly. Any other match will be proposed in the <cite>Fuzzy 
Matches</cite> window.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="omegat.png" width="663" height="401"></p>
<p>When you are done with translating you need to generate the translated files 
out of OmegaT. To do this select the <cite>Create Target Documents</cite> 
command from the <cite>Project</cite> menu.</p>
<p>This will create a translated version of the documents in the <code>target</code> 
sub-directory of the project.</p>
<h2><a name="postProcessing"></a>Post-Processing the Translated Files</h2>
<p>Once the translated files have been generated, you can use the <b>
<a href="http://www.opentag.com/okapi/wiki/index.php?title=Rainbow_-_Translation_Package_Post-Processing">Translation 
Package Post-Processing</a></b> utility to merge the translation back into the 
original file formats.</p>
<p>Start Rainbow</p>
<p>Drop the manifest of the project (<code>manifest.xml</code>) in the <cite>
Input List 1</cite> list of Rainbow.</p>
<p>Select the <cite>Translation Package Post-Processing</cite> command from the
<cite>Utilities</cite> menu. the manifest is read and its content displayed in 
the <cite>Translation Package Manifest</cite> dialog box:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="manifest.png" width="586" height="438"></p>
<p>If needed you can select which documents you want to post-process.</p>
<p>Click <cite>Execute</cite> to start the post-processing.</p>
<p>The program creates a <code>done</code> sub-directory in the project where 
all the translated final documents are saved. The original directory structure 
is also re-constructed when needed.</p>
<p>You should be able to open them with their corresponding applications.</p>
