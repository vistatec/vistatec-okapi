<h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p><b>IMPORTANT: This page may not reflect the latest changes in the pipeline 
mechanism from the previous release. <br>
The pipeline mechanism is under development and its API may change from release 
to release.</b></p>
<p>Pipelines are a powerful mechanism to apply a sequence of actions to an input 
document (or a set of them). They allow you to construct processes customized to specific projects 
very easily, re-using the same components. For example, many tasks can be broken down into these main parts:</p>
<p>Extract the text &gt;&gt; Apply some changes to the text &gt;&gt; Merge back the 
modified text into 
its original format.</p>
<p>With the framework this type of sequence is implemented using the following 
interfaces:</p>
<p><code><a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/filters/IFilter.html">IFilter</a></code> 
&gt;&gt; <code><a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/pipeline/IPipelineStep.html">
IPipelineStep</a></code> &gt;&gt; <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/filterwriter/IFilterWriter.html">
IFilterWriter</a></code></p>
<p>The pipeline is the glue that puts these parts together and allows you to include as many as you 
need.</p>
<h2><a name="simplePipeline"></a>Simple Pipeline</h2>
<p>A pipeline is represented by a <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/pipeline/IPipeline.html">IPipeline</a></code> 
interface. The framework offers several implementations for it. The simplest is 
the <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/pipeline/Pipeline.html">Pipeline</a></code> 
class.</p>
<p>The easiest way to set up and execute a pipeline is to use a pipeline driver. 
It is represented by the <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/pipeline/IPipelineDriver.html">IPipelineDriver</a></code> interface and provides all 
you need to process one or more input documents through a pipeline.</p>
<p>The first step is to create the driver:</p>
<pre>// Create a pipeline driver
IPipelineDriver driver = new PipelineDriver();</pre>
<p>The next step is to add the different steps you want in the pipeline. In this 
example we are going to simply extract the translatable text from the original 
format and re-write it back. These two operations are very common and they have 
corresponding steps already coded for you: the
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/steps/common/RawDocumentToFilterEventsStep.html">
<code>
RawDocumentToFilterEventsStep</code></a> class and the <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/steps/common/FilterEventsWriterStep.html">
FilterEventsWriterStep</a></code> class.</p>
<pre>// Add the filter step
driver.addStep(new RawDocumentToFilterEventsStep());
// Add the filter writer step
driver.addStep(new FilterEventsWriterStep());</pre>
<p>Because our pipeline uses a filter we need to provide a way to know which 
filter to use with which input document. This is done in two settings:</p>
<ul>
	<li>With the input document, we will provide a filter configuration ID.</li>
	<li>An object that implements the <code>
	<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/filters/IFilterConfigurationMapper.html">
	IFilterConfigurationMapper</a></code> interface needs to be set in the 
	pipeline context, so any step that needs to create a filter for an input 
	document can use this mapper to lookup the filter configuration ID of the 
	document and retrieve the filter and the filter's parameters to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each calling application can provide its own implementation of <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/filters/IFilterConfigurationMapper.html">
IFilterConfigurationMapper</a></code> or, like in this example, use directly the 
one provided with the library: the <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/filters/FilterConfigurationMapper.html">
FilterConfigurationMapper</a></code> class.</p>
<pre>// Create the filter configuration mapper
IFilterConfigurationMapper fcMapper = new FilterConfigurationMapper();</pre>
<p>In a real application, you would use some kind of discovery mechanism to get 
the different filters available to you and add their default configurations to 
the mapper. But, if needed, you can also easily hard-code this:</p>
<pre>// Fill the mapper with the default configurations of a few filters
fcMapper.addConfigurations(&quot;net.sf.okapi.filters.html.HtmlFilter&quot;);
fcMapper.addConfigurations(&quot;net.sf.okapi.filters.openoffice.OpenOfficeFilter&quot;);
fcMapper.addConfigurations(&quot;net.sf.okapi.filters.properties.PropertiesFilter&quot;);
fcMapper.addConfigurations(&quot;net.sf.okapi.filters.xml.XMLFilter&quot;);</pre>
<p>The last task is the associate the mapper to the pipeline:</p>
<pre>// Set the filter configuration mapper
driver.setFilterConfigurationMapper(fcMapper);</pre>
<p>Now the driver is all set up to process your documents. Executing the 
pipeline for a given input document is done by first providing the document and 
its parameters, and then by invoking the driver.</p>
<p>Usually we have more than one document to process. A set of input documents 
is called a batch, and both the driver and the pipeline are designed to work 
with batches. A batch item corresponds to the input for a single execution of 
the pipeline. It is usually made of a single input document. But some steps may 
require several input documents per batch item. For example a step that would 
perform an alignment between a source document and its translation may request 
two input documents for each batch item.</p>
<p>To allow the feeding of the batch item to the pipeline is done with the <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/pipeline/IBatchItemContext.html">
IBatchItemContext</a></code> interface. It provides the method to access the 
parameters for one or more input document per batch item. One important 
advantage of using an interface for this is that your application can store its 
input data any way it wants, and simply can expose the way the pipeline expects 
by simply implementing that interface.</p>
<p>The driver offers several variations of the <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/pipeline/IPipelineDriver.html">
IPipelineDriver.addBatchItem()</a></code> method to facilitate the creation of 
the batch. In our case, our pipeline needs one input document per batch item, 
and its corresponding output parameters. We can use the following code to add 
one batch item to the driver:</p>
<pre>// Add one batch item to the batch
driver.addBatchItem(
   new BatchItemContext(
      (new File(&quot;myFile.html&quot;)).toURI(), // URI of the input document
      &quot;UTF-8&quot;, // Default encoding
      &quot;okf_html&quot;, // Filter configuration of the document
      (new File(&quot;myFile.out.html&quot;)).toURI(), // Output
      &quot;UTF-8&quot;, // Encoding for the output
      LocaleId.fromString(&quot;en&quot;), // Source locale
      LocaleId.fromString(&quot;fr&quot;) // Target locale
   )
);</pre>
<p>We are now ready to execute the pipeline for the given input document. This 
is done in one call:</p>
<pre>// Execute the pipeline for all batch items
driver.processBatch();</pre>
<p>When this process is done you should have a new document <code>
myFile.out.html</code> that should be a copy of <code>myFile.html</code> with 
possibly some small modifications, such as the language declarations changed 
from <code>en</code> to <code>fr</code>.</p>
<p>Note that you can also run the exact same pipeline on input documents that 
are in different file formats, as long as you provide the proper filter 
configuration ID with each one.</p>
<h2><a name="creatingSteps"></a>Creating Steps</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Now we want to modify the pipeline we created in the previous 
section, so it does something more meaningful than rewrite the input documents. 
We can do this by adding an extra step between the two we currently have. This 
step will receive filter events from the first step, and send them down to the 
next step that will write the output file. The only thing we have to do is write 
the part that modify the extracted text we get through the <code>TEXT_UNIT</code> 
events. Let's create a step that pseudo-translate the extracted text.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This requires to create a new class that implements 
the <code><a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/pipeline/IPipelineStep.html">IPipelineStep</a></code> interface. The framework makes things easy by 
providing the class <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/pipeline/BasePipelineStep.html">BasePipelineStep</a></code> that you can 
use to derive you own steps.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are only a few methods we need to overwrite:</p>
<p>The <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/pipeline/IPipelineStep.html#getName()">
IPipelineStep.getName()</a></code> method should return the name of the step. 
This name is localizable and is used by other applications when they need to 
associate the step to a visual label. It should be short and descriptive. For 
example: &quot;<code>Pseudo-Translation</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>The <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/pipeline/IPipelineStep.html#getDescription()">IPipelineStep.getDescription()</a></code> 
method should return a brief description of what the step does. This text is 
localizable and is used by other applications when they need to associate the 
step with a short description. It should be one or two short descriptive 
sentences. For example: &quot;<code>Pseudo-translate text units content.</code>&quot;</p>
<p>Then we need to override any of the event handler methods you need. In our 
case we just need to override one: <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/pipeline/BasePipelineStep.html#handleTextUnit(net.sf.okapi.common.Event)">
BasePipelineSetp.handleTextUnit()</code></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The code below shows our new step class. It intercepts the 
<code>TEXT_UNIT</code> events and performs a simple pseudo-translation by replacing some ASCII characters by 
the same ones with accents, so the text <code>&quot;A goose quill is more dangerous 
than a lion's claw&quot;</code> becomes <code>&quot;A gõõsè qüìll ìs mõrè ðåñgèrõüs thåñ å 
lìõñ's çlåw&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>In order to create the target text in the text unit, the class needs to know what the 
target language is. A pipeline step publishes the runtime parameters it needs 
using the standard JavaBean pattern, along with a special Java annotation. In 
our case, we declare a <code>setTargetLocale()</code> method. The pipeline 
driver will introspect the steps and provide the proper parameters from the
<code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/pipeline/IBatchItemContext.html">
IBatchItemContext</a></code> interface.</p>
<p>The other parts of the code deal with changing the text 
unit content itself. See the section
<a href="gettingstarted.html#TextUnits">Working with Text Units</a> for more 
details on how to modify text units.</p>
<pre>public class PseudoTranslateStep extends BasePipelineStep {

   private static final String OLDCHARS = &quot;aeiouycdn&quot;;
   private static final String NEWCHARS = &quot;\u00e5\u00e8\u00ec\u00f5\u00fc\u00ff\u00e7\u00f0\u00f1&quot;;

   private LocaleId trgLoc;

   @StepParameterMapping(parameterType = StepParameterType.TARGET_LOCALE)
   public void setTargetLocale (LocaleId targetLocale) {
      trgLoc = targetLocale;
   }

   public String getName () {
      return &quot;Pseudo-Translation&quot;;
   }

   public String getDescription () {
      return &quot;Pseudo-translates text units content.&quot;;
   }

   protected void handleTextUnit (Event event) {
      TextUnit tu = (TextUnit)event.getResource();
      if ( !tu.isTranslatable() ) return;

      TextFragment tf = tu.createTarget(trgLoc, false, IResource.COPY_CONTENT);
      StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder(tf.getCodedText());
      int n;
      for ( int i=0; i&lt;text.length(); i++ ) {
         if ( TextFragment.isMarker(text.charAt(i)) ) {
            i++; // Skip the pair
         }
         else {
            if ( (n = OLDCHARS.indexOf(text.charAt(i))) &gt; -1 ) {
               text.setCharAt(i, NEWCHARS.charAt(n));
            }
         }
      }
      tf.setCodedText(text.toString());
   }
}</pre>
<p>Once we have created our new class, we simply need to add it between the input and output steps 
of our previous code:</p>
<pre>// Add the filter step
driver.addStep(new RawDocumentToFilterEventsStep());
// Add the pseudo-translation step
driver.addStep(new PseudoTranslateStep());
// Add the filter writer step
driver.addStep(new FilterEventsWriterStep());</pre>
<p>At first it may seems more complicated to create a new class for each new step instead 
of working directly in a single class, But the benefits are important: 
Each step defined as a separate class can be easily re-used in different processes.</p>
<p>You should see each step as a component independent of everything else. It 
should not be filter-specific and avoid using global parameters. It should, most 
of the time, not expect to be before or after another specific step. It should also 
be aware of inline codes, as well as the translate and the preserve-whitespaces 
information attached to each text unit. The <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/resource/TextUnit.html">TextUnit</a></code> 
class may provide plenty of information you can query: <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/resource/TextUnit.html#getType()">
TextUnit.getType()</a></code>, <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/resource/TextUnit.html#getName()">
TextUnit.getName()</a></code>, <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/resource/TextUnit.html#getMimeType()">
TextUnit.getMimeType()</a></code>, <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/resource/TextUnit.html#getAnnotation(java.lang.Class)">
TextUnit.getAnnotation()</a></code>, <code>
<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/common/resource/TextUnit.html#getProperty(java.lang.String)">
TextUnit.getProperty()</a></code>, etc. Make use of them to drive the different 
actions performed on the extracted text.</p>
<h2><a name="pipelineEvents"></a>Pipeline Events</h2>
<p>When a pipeline is executed the following sequence of events are are 
dispatched:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>START_BATCH</code> - The batch starts. This is the opportunity for 
	the steps to initialize themselves as needed.</li>
	<li>For each batch item:<ul>
		<li><code>START_BATCH_ITEM</code> - A new batch item starts. This is the 
		opportunity for the steps to perform any initialization that depend on 
		each batch item.</li>
		<li><code>RAW_DOCUMENT</code> is the normal way to start the pipeline. 
		From here the events sent down the pipeline depends on each step.<ul>
			<li>Some steps, like <code>
			<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/steps/common/RawDocumentToFilterEventsStep.html">RawDocumentToFilterEventsStep</a></code>, 
			may send <a href="filters.html#filterEvents">filter events</a> until 
			the document is completely parsed.</li>
			<li>Some steps may take a <code>RAW_DOCUMENT</code> event, modify 
			the document, and send a new <code>RAW_DOCUMENT</code> event down 
			the pipeline.</li>
			<li>Some steps, like <code>
			<a href="../javadoc/net/sf/okapi/steps/common/FilterEventsToRawDocumentStep.html">
			FilterEventsToRawDocument</a></code>, may take
			<a href="filters.html#filterEvents">filter events</a> and convert 
			them into a single <code>RAW_DOCUMENT</code> to the next step.</li>
			<li><code>CUSTOM</code>, <code>CANCEL</code> and <code>NO_OP</code> 
			events may be received at any time. All steps must be capable of 
			handling any event. If a step does not know what to do with a given 
			event it should simply pass it on without any modification.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><code>END_BATCH_ITEM</code> - The current batch item is done. This 
		is the time to perform any task that works at the batch-item level. For 
		example, a word-counting step would now compute the total word count for 
		all text units found in the input document of this batch item.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><code>END_BATCH</code> - The last batch item of this batch was done, we 
	are ending the batch. This is the time for the steps to trigger any task 
	that works at the batch level. For example, a word-counting step would now 
	compute the total word count for all the input documents of this batch.</li>
</ul>
